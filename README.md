Project Name:  Museum Website

Introduction:
We are tasked to develop a website for a private museum owner. This website is to exhibit the complete collection of the owner, categorized by the type of artifacts with details. Only the museum admin can create, modify, update and delete the database items as they acquire new artifacts. Guests can only view the exhibited items. There is to be a page for support and donation details.

Features:
Home page containing general information, brief preview of categories and link to all other pages.
Categories have different webpages.
Create, Read, Update and Delete operation for admin only.
Separate page for donation information

Methodology:
All the webpages are made using frontend languages. This includes a homepage and 5-7 other pages linked to the homepage including the different exhibit pages and contact,about us. The information in the pages, such as exhibit item info and pictures come from the database created using SQL. The database is connected to the frontend using backend language. Finally, the whole website is hosted on XAMPP.


Discussion:

This project is about making a small website for  small collection owners who wish to promote their private collections. This way, private museums can raise cultural awareness among the public. In addition it can  help people who are unable to physically visit the museum, to watch the exhibition online and raise their interests in cultural history. It can also help the owners to raise funds to run the upkeep costs and scale up the museum for better future experience. 
There may also be other collection owners who may have items of value, but are unable to run a museum. This type of website can help them run a museum online to benefit both them and the people.
